**Sign Recognition System**

This Python script is designed to recognize signs from a given dataset of images. It leverages techniques such as image cropping, feature extraction (HOG and LBP), and machine learning (SVM) to classify the signs.

**How to Use:**

1. **Update Image Directory:**
   - Modify the `imageDirectory` variable in the script to point to the directory containing your image dataset.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

**Dependencies:**

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-image
- Scikit-learn
